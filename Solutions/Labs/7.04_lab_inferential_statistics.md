### Part 1

Data :

Machine 1:
mean = 42.14
standard deviation = 0.683
samples = 10

Machine 2:
mean = 43.23
standard deviation = 0.750
samples = 10

        H0: μ1 = μ2
        Ha: μ1 < μ2
        significance level 0.05

        pooled standard deviation is 0.7173
        test statistic = -3.398

It is a left tailed test with a critical value of -1.7341
test statistic < critical value, hence we are in the rejection region. 
We reject the null hypothesis. Alternative hypothesis is true. Machine 2 is faster.

### Part 2


Data :

Sophomore:
mean = 2.8
standard deviation = 0.52
samples = 17

Junior:
mean = 2.981
standard deviation = 0.3093
samples = 13

        H0: μ1 = μ2
        Ha: μ1 != μ2
        significance level 0.05

        test statistic = -0.92
        Critical value = -2.048

test statistic > critical value, hence we are not in the rejection region. 
We fail to reject the null hypothesis. Hence there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Also p value here is 0.36 which is larger than 0.05.
